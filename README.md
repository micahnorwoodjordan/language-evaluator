# language-evaluator
i want to get a feel for how many words i know in any given language...should help a little in evaluating fluency progress
this would make the most sense by creating a journaling utility that indexes individual language tokens to slowly track progress


# TODOS:
index import:
  - use case:
    - maybe a user utilized the journal utility "offline" and would like to import their stats into a live instance of the utility
